# 4chan XZ

This is a project that aims to re-factor the 4chan X source code from Coffee script into Typescript

The project is a mess right now, but it is slowly getting better.

> [!NOTE]  
> Alot of the commits and changes are done by AI, Aka ChatGPT and Github Copilot.

## Building

The only requirement currently only that the bare minimum of the script works. IE: You can see the threads and no errors are thrown.

Right now the only testing there is, is the testing I do manually.

## The Future

It is highly likely that I will switch from using this projects own Jquery like system to using Jquery itself
\
This is because I am not a fan of the current system and it is a pain to work with.
